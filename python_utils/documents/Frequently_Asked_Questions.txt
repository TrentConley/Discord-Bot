Why do some transactions take longer than others to process on Prime?

Prime Protocol is a cross-chain platform, with support for many different blockchains. Some blockchains naturally have a longer time to reach finality for transactions, meaning that transactions on those chains will take longer to process. We introduced Universal Access to allow users to initiate transactions on any supported chain on the platform while paying gas fees using any other chain supported on Prime to help alleviate some of these finality issues and help save our users time and money for their transactions.
